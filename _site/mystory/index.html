    <h2 id="my-journey-into-data-science">My Journey into Data Science</h2>

<p>Since I was three years old, I’ve loved math. I was obsessed with numbers and enjoyed learning new concepts while competing in various competitions. While I had continued with my passion for numerous years, with the start of the pandemic in 2020, something had changed.</p>

<p>I had been inconsistently physically exercising, but this time, I decided I would commit myself to bodybuilding. I was in love with the process: putting in hard work now (eating a strict diet with painful workouts) to obtain things I valued (great health, an aesthetic physique, strength, and an immense dopamine release). I was a bodybuilding-obsessed teenage boy from 2020-2022; I tracked all my nutrients, followed intense programs, and uploaded YouTube videos in hopes of informing and inspiring others.</p>

<p>Yet, one day shifted bodybuilding from my greatest obsession to a hobby. At the time, I enjoyed mountain biking and had built a ramp in my neighborhood. I made a few bad moves, crashed, and broke my wrist. This injury taught me invaluable lessons; but, most importantly, it highlighted the fragility of the human body. I realized that what put humans at the top of the animal hierarchy was not our physical size. Rather, our advanced brains and concomitant ability to engage in high-level thinking allowed us to outsmart other species.</p>

<p>When I realized that the true power of a human being lies not in their physical strength, but rather in their ability to critically think, communicate, convince, and cooperate, I decided it’d be best if I cultivated these gifts. I embarked on a self-guided journey where I followed my interests and learned what I deemed useful.</p>

<p>Around this time, I also became infatuated with OpenAI’s ChatGPT. I didn’t know how this worked, but I did know that humans had just created something revolutionary. Machine learning specifically intrigued me. Who knew that the math I had loved as a kid could give machines the ability to perform computations and feign intelligence? I felt as if things had gone in a perfect circle: I had rekindled my old love for mathematics.</p>

<p>I concluded that I wanted to enter this field and make a positive impact on the world by applying the lessons I learned from bodybuilding to a technical field. While studying Data Science at university is a stepping stone along my journey, my ultimate goal is to apply this learned knowledge to improve the world and the human condition. By utilizing machine learning to optimize business decisions, supply chains, factory processes, logistics, and more, this dream can become a reality.</p>
